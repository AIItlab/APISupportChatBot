      answer: (
        <>
          <p>"JourneyKey" and "AvailabilityKey" should be added in request body. In case of roundtrips, another pair of the previous keys is added but for the return flight. This error returns in API response if the pairs of "JourneyKey" and "AvailabilityKey" are duplicate with the same values.</p>

      question: "Q18: Is it possible to cancel a booking via APIs?",
      answer; (
        <>
          <p>Booking cancelation is not possible via any APIs. For this, you can contact Jazeera Airways call center or via logging-in to your Jazeera airways portal account: In https://www.jazeeraairways.com/en-kw click login at top right corner.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Also, some fare classes are not refundable. For more information, refer to fare class options and rules: https://www.jazeeraairways.com/en-kw/plan/flight-information/fare-options</p>

      question: "Q20: What is token expiry / idle time?",
      answer: "Token idle timeout is 15 minutes. That is, the token will expire if idle time between each two consecutive API calls is greater than or equal to 15 minutes."

      question: "Q21: Is it possible to add SSRs or assign a seat after paying and committing the booking?",
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>Yes, it is. Generally it is better to add SSRs, assign seats or add any charged service before committing the booking. Still, if addition is possible. In this case, you need to pay the difference using addPaymentToBooking API. Then commit the booking using (PUT) CommitBooking API.</p>
